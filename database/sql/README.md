**SQL tips and tricks**

A (somewhat opinionated) list of SQL tips and tricks that I've picked up over the years in my job as a data analyst.

Please note that some of these tips might not be relevant for all RDBMs. For example, the `::` syntax ([tip 5](#you-can-use-the--operator-to-cast-the-data-type-of-a-value)) does not work in SQLite.

## Formatting/readability

### Use a leading comma to separate fields

Use a leading comma to seperate fields in the `SELECT` clause rather than a trailing comma.

- Clearly defines that this is a new column vs code that's wrapped to multiple lines.

- Visual cue to easily identify if the comma is missing or not. Varying line lengths makes it harder to determine.

```sql
SELECT
employee_id
, employee_name
, job
, salary
FROM employees
;
```

- Also use a leading `AND` in the `WHERE` clause, for the same reasons (following tip demonstrates this).

### **Use a dummy value in the WHERE clause**

Use a dummy value in the `WHERE` clause so you can easily comment out conditions when testing or tweaking a query.

```SQL
-- If I want to comment out the job condition the following query will break.
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE
--job IN ('Clerk', 'Manager')
AND dept_no != 5
;

-- With a dummy value there's no issue. I can comment out all the conditions and 1=1 will ensure the query still runs.
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE 1=1
-- AND job IN ('Clerk', 'Manager')
AND dept_no != 5
;
```

### Indent your code where appropriate

Indent your code to make it more readable to colleagues and your future self:

```SQL
-- Bad:
SELECT
timeslot_date
, timeslot_channel
, overnight_fta_share
, IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) > 7, LAG(overnight_fta_share, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity), NULL) AS C7_fta_share
, IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) >= 29, LAG(overnight_fta_share, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity), NULL) AS C28_fta_share
FROM timeslot_data
;

-- Good:
SELECT
timeslot_date
, timeslot_channel
, overnight_fta_share
, IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) > 7, -- First argument of IFF.
 LAG(overnight_fta_share, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity), -- Second argument of IFF.
  NULL) AS C7_fta_share -- Third argument of IFF.
, IFF(DATEDIFF(DAY, timeslot_date, CURRENT_DATE()) >= 29,
  LAG(overnight_fta_share, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY timeslot_date, timeslot_channel ORDER BY timeslot_activity),
   NULL) AS C28_fta_share
FROM timeslot_data
;
```

### Consider CTEs when writing complex queries

For longer than I'd care to admit I would nest inline views, which would lead to
queries that were hard to understand, particularly if revisted after a few weeks.

If you find yourself nesting inline views more than 2 or 3 levels deep,
consider using common table expressions, which can help you keep your code more organised and readable.

```SQL
/*
The following query doesn't actually need to use an inline view or CTE but I'm just
demonstrating the difference between the two.
*/

-- Using nested inline views.
SELECT
vhs.movie
, vhs.vhs_revenue
, cs.cinema_revenue
FROM
    (
    SELECT
    movie_id
    , SUM(ticket_sales) AS cinema_revenue
    FROM tickets
    GROUP BY movie_id
    ) AS cs
    INNER JOIN
        (
        SELECT
        movie
        , movie_id
        , SUM(revenue) AS vhs_revenue
        FROM blockbuster
        GROUP BY movie, movie_id
        ) AS vhs
        ON cs.movie_id = vhs.movie_id
;

-- Using CTEs.
WITH cinema_sales AS
    (
        SELECT
        movie_id
        , SUM(ticket_sales) AS cinema_revenue
        FROM tickets
        GROUP BY movie_id
    ),
    vhs_sales AS
    (
        SELECT
        movie
        , movie_id
        , SUM(revenue) AS vhs_revenue
        FROM blockbuster
        GROUP BY movie, movie_id
    )
SELECT
vhs.movie
, vhs.vhs_revenue
, cs.cinema_revenue
FROM cinema_sales AS cs
    INNER JOIN vhs_sales AS vhs
    ON cs.movie_id = vhs.movie_id
;
```

## Useful features

### You can use the `::` operator to cast the data type of a value

In some RDBMs you can use the `::` operator to cast a value from one data type to another:

```SQL
SELECT CAST('5' AS INTEGER); -- Using the CAST function.
SELECT '5'::INTEGER; -- Using :: syntax.
```

### Anti-joins are your friend

Anti-joins are incredible useful, mostly (in my experience) for when you only want to return rows/values from one table that aren't present in another table.

- You could instead use a subquery although conventional wisdom dictates that
  anti-joins are faster.
- `EXCEPT` is an interesting operator for removing rows from one table which appear in another query table but I suggest you read up on it further before using it.

```SQL
-- Anti-join.
SELECT
video_content.*
FROM video_content
    LEFT JOIN archive
    on video_content.series_id = archive.series_id
WHERE 1=1
AND archive.series_id IS NULL -- Any rows with no match will have a NULL value.

-- Subquery.
SELECT
*
FROM video_content
WHERE 1=1
AND series_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT SERIES_ID FROM archive) -- Be mindful of NULL values.

-- Correlated subquery.
SELECT
*
FROM video_content vc
WHERE 1=1
AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM archive a
        WHERE a.series_id = vc.series_id
    )

-- EXCEPT.
SELECT series_id
FROM video_content
EXCEPT
SELECT series_id
FROM archive
```

### Use `QUALIFY` to filter window functions

`QUALIFY` lets you filter the results of a query based on a window function. This is useful for a variety of reasons, including to
reduce the number of lines of code needed.

For example, if I want to return the top 10 markets per product I can use
`QUALIFY` rather than an inline view:

```SQL
-- Using QUALIFY:
SELECT
product
, market
, SUM(revenue) AS market_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product, market
QUALIFY DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC)  <= 10
ORDER BY product, market_revenue
;

-- Without QUALIFY:
SELECT
product
, market
, market_revenue
FROM
(
SELECT
product
, market
, SUM(revenue) AS market_revenue
, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC) AS market_rank
FROM sales
GROUP BY product, market
)
WHERE market_rank  <= 10
ORDER BY product, market_revenue
;
```

### You can (but shouldn't always) `GROUP BY` column position

Instead of using the column name, you can `GROUP BY` or `ORDER BY` using the
column position.

- This can be useful for ad-hoc/one-off queries, but for production code
  you should always refer to a column by its name.

```SQL
SELECT
dept_no
, SUM(salary) AS dept_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY 1 -- dept_no is the first column in the SELECT clause.
ORDER BY 2 DESC
;
```

### Use `EXCLUDE` to... exclude... columns

Sometimes I want to return all columns from a table except for one and I don't want to have to write
out the name of every column in the `SELECT` clause (particularly if there are a lot of columns!). In this scenario you can use `EXCLUDE`.

- Be aware that if columns are added to the table without you realising, by using `EXCEPT` you will return columns you might not want! Being lazy can have its consequences.

```SQL
SELECT * EXCLUDE(salary)
FROM employees
;
```

### You can create a grand total with `GROUP BY ROLLUP`

Creating a grand total (or sub-totals) is possible thanks to `GROUP BY ROLLUP`.

For example, if you've aggregated a company's employees salary per department you
can use `GROUP BY ROLLUP` to create a grand total that sums up the aggregated
`dept_salary` column.

```SQL
SELECT
COALESCE(dept_no, 'Total') AS dept_no
, SUM(salary) AS dept_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP(dept_no)
ORDER BY dept_salary -- Be sure to order by this column to ensure the Total appears last/at the bottom of the result set.
```

## Common pitfalls

### Be aware of how `NOT IN` behaves with `NULL` values

`NOT IN` doesn't work if `NULL` is present in the values being checked against. As `NULL` represents Unknown the SQL engine can't verify that the value being checked is not present in the list.

- Instead use `NOT EXISTS`.

```SQL
INSERT INTO departments (id)
VALUES (1), (2), (NULL);

-- Doesn't work due to NULL being present.
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT id from departments)

-- Solution.
SELECT *
FROM employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM departments d
    WHERE d.id = e.department_id
)
;
```

### Rename calculated fields to avoiding ambiguity

When creating a calculated field, you might be tempted to rename it to an
existing column, but this can lead to unexpected behaviour, such as a
window function operating on the wrong field:

```SQL
INSERT INTO products (product, revenue)
VALUES
    ('Shark', 100),
    ('Robot', 150),
    ('Alien', 90);

-- The window function will rank the 'Robot' product as 1 when it should be 3.
SELECT
product
, CASE product WHEN 'Robot' THEN 0 ELSE revenue END AS revenue
, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC)
FROM products
```

### Always specify which column belongs to which table

When you have complex queries with multiple joins, it pays to be able to
trace back an issue with a value to its source.

Additionally, your RDBMS might raise an error if two tables share the same
column name and you don't specify which column you are using.

```SQL
SELECT
vc.video_id
, vc.series_name
, metadata.season
, metadata.episode_number
FROM video_content AS vc
    INNER JOIN video_metadata AS metadata
    ON vc.video_id = metadata.video_id
```

### Understand the order of execution

If I had to give one piece of advice to someone learning SQL, it'd be to understand the order of
execution (of clauses). It will completely change how you write queries. This [blog post](https://blog.jooq.org/a-beginners-guide-to-the-true-order-of-sql-operations/) is a fantastic resource for learning.

### Comment your code

While in the moment you know why you did something, if you revisit
the code weeks, months or years later you might not remember.

- In general you should strive to write comments that explain why you did something, not how.
- Your colleagues and future self will thank you!

```SQL
SELECT
video_content.*
FROM video_content
    LEFT JOIN archive -- New CMS cannot process archive video formats.
    on video_content.series_id = archive.series_id
WHERE 1=1
AND archive.series_id IS NULL
```

### Read the documentation (in full)

Using Snowflake I once needed to return the latest date from a list of columns
and so I decided to use `GREATEST()`.

What I didn't realise was that if one of the
arguments is `NULL` then the function returns `NULL`.

If I'd read the documentation in full I'd have known! In many cases it can take just a minute or less to scan
the documentation and it will save you the headache of having to work
out why something isn't working the way you expected:

```SQL
-- If I'd read the documentation further I'd also have realised that my solution
--to the NULL problem with GREATEST()...

SELECT COALESCE(GREATEST(signup_date, consumption_date), signup_date, consumption_date)

-- ... could have been solved with the following function:
SELECT GREATEST_IGNORE_NULLS(signup_date, consumption_date)
```

### Use descriptive names for your saved queries

There's almost nothing worse than not being able to find a query you need to re-run/refer back to.

Use a descriptive name when saving your queries so you can easily find what you're looking for.

I usually will write the subject of the query, the month the query was ran and the name of the requester (if they exist).
For example: `Lapsed users analysis - 2023-09-01 - Olivia Roberts`
