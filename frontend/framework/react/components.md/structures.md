# Component Structures

## 1. Atomic Design:

- Atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages: Breaking down components into smaller, reusable pieces.

## 2. Container/Presentational Components:

- Containers: Responsible for data fetching, state management, and business logic.
- Presentational components: Focused on UI rendering, receiving data through props.

## 3. Feature-Based Structure:

- Grouping components by feature: Organize components based on the features or functionalities they represent.

## 4. Component Type Structure:

- Separating components by type: Grouping them by their function (e.g., buttons, forms, cards, modals).

## 5. Hierarchy-Based Structure:

- Parent/child relationships: Organizing components based on their relationship within the app's UI hierarchy.

## 6. Route-Based Structure:

- Grouping components by routes: Particularly useful in Next.js for organizing pages and their associated components.

## 7. Atomic/Functional Mix:

- Combining Atomic Design with functional grouping: For instance, using atoms and molecules in conjunction with feature-based structuring.
