# Start Development

## What we need to decide for development as team?
- Framework (React or plus Next.js, Vue.js, Svelte, etc.)
- Coding Standard (How to write)
  - [Best Practice](./framework/react/best-practice.md) for React case
  - [ESlint, Prettier settings](./linter/README.md)
  - [Design Pattern](./framework/react/design-pattern.md) for coding consistency
  - [Architecture](./framework/react/architecture.md) as Directory structure
- Component Library like [MUI](./component/mui.md)
