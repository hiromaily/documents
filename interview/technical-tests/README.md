# 技術試験

## Coding Challenges

- Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal are commonly used to present algorithmic and data structure problems.
- These challenges test problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and understanding of fundamental concepts.

## Technical Interviews

- Live coding interviews where you solve problems in real-time, often using shared coding environments or platforms like CoderPad.
- These interviews can focus on specific languages or technologies relevant to the job, such as JavaScript, Python, or Rust.

## Take-Home Projects

- Small projects or tasks that you complete on your own time. These might involve building a small web application, implementing a specific feature, or fixing bugs.
- These tests evaluate your ability to write clean, maintainable code and follow best practices.

## System Design Interviews

- These assess your ability to design and architect scalable systems.
- You might be asked to design the backend of a web application, a RESTful API, or a distributed system.
- These interviews evaluate your understanding of system components, databases, APIs, and scalability concerns.

## Pair Programming

- A collaborative coding session where you work with an interviewer on a problem or project.
- This tests your ability to communicate, collaborate, and problem-solve in a team setting.

## Technical Questions

- Questions about specific technologies, frameworks, or libraries that you have listed on your resume.
- This can include questions on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js), back-end technologies (e.g., Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails), databases (SQL, NoSQL), and more.

## Code Reviews

- Reviewing and providing feedback on a piece of code. This tests your understanding of code quality, readability, and best practices.

## DevOps and Deployment

- Tests related to setting up CI/CD pipelines, working with Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- This evaluates your understanding of deployment processes, automation, and infrastructure management.
