# Content-Security-Policy

There are many other HTTP security response headers that can be used to set Content Security Policies and improve the security of your web application. It's important to carefully consider the specific security risks you are trying to mitigate and choose the appropriate headers to address those risks.

## Content-Security-Policy
This header can be used to set a Content Security Policy (CSP) for your web application. For example, you can set a policy that only allows resources to be loaded from trusted domains, such as:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' https://trusted-domain.com;
```
This policy would only allow resources to be loaded from the current domain and the trusted domain https://trusted-domain.com.


## X-Content-Type-Options
This header can be used to prevent MIME type sniffing, which can help protect against certain types of attacks. For example:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```
This header would instruct the browser not to sniff the MIME type of the response, and instead use the content-type specified in the response headers.

## X-Frame-Options
This header can be used to prevent clickjacking attacks, which can be used to trick users into clicking on a hidden or disguised link. For example:

```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```
This header would prevent the page from being loaded in a frame or iframe, which can help protect against clickjacking attacks.

## X-XSS-Protection
This header can be used to enable the browser's built-in XSS protection, which can help protect against cross-site scripting attacks. For example:

```
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```
This header would enable the browser's built-in XSS protection and instruct it to block the page if an XSS attack is detected.
